# aperture-photometry
This repository is for my aperture photometry projects.



The files with TEST in the name are unorganized notebooks that 

contain my initial attempts at performing aperture photometry with Photutils.



The files whose names begin with L# (for example, "L2_photutils-detection.ipynb") correspond to my YouTube Astropy tutorials.
